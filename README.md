This repository contains a simple implementation of a text summarization tool using the facebook/bart-large-cnn model, a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The model is specifically fine-tuned for extractive and abstractive summarization tasks, providing concise and coherent summaries from input text.
